            <h2>About Clarens, South Africa.</h2>
            <p>Located at the base of the Maluti Mountains in South Africa's Free State province, the little town of Clarens is known as the "Jewel of the Eastern Free State" due to its charming location. It was founded in 1912 and given the name of the Swiss town of Clarens, where fugitive politician Paul Kruger spent his final days. </p>
            <p>Many famous painters call Clarens home or visit often because of the abundance of galleries that line its main plaza and pepper the rest of town. Clarens is a favorite escape for city dwellers from Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, and Durban due to its peaceful village atmosphere, beautiful scenery, and warm climate. Clarens is one of the most beautiful places in South Africa, and its sandstone mountains and pleasant environment have earned it reputation as some of the country's top Trout Fishing grounds.</p>

                    <p>The Titanic Rock is a big, magnificent rock formation in the Free State area of South Africa. It is near the town of Clarens. It got its name because the pointy part that sticks out of the ground makes it look like the RMS Titanic, which sank. The rock is made of sandstone, which gives it a unique reddish-brown color. It is thought to be about 190 million years old. The Titanic Rock is a popular place for tourists to visit, and people who come to the area often take pictures of it. It is also a famous place for rock climbing and hiking, and from the top you can see a beautiful view of the area.</p>
