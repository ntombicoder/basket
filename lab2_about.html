            <h2>Other options that Might Help With The Problem</h2>
            <p>A catch share system, in which fishermen and fisheries are each granted a certain percentage of a scientifically calculated amount of fish to be caught during the season, is one option that has recently been explored in the United States. Shares can be bought and sold by fisherman for profit, and the fishery is able to compensate those who work for less money and produce a higher quality catch. While each fisherman has a financial stake in the health of the local fish stock, catch share strategies have been effective in reducing overfishing. Such measures have proven effective throughout the coasts of the United States and might be an excellent addition to any of these four eco-friendly fishing strategies in South Africa.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Hook and Lining:</b>This is sustainable because any fish caught by accident that the hunter doesn't plan to sell can be set free right away.</li>
                <li><b>Harpooning:</b>This kind of fishing is sustainable because the fly fisher with the harpoon is only trying to catch the fish he wants.</li>
                <li><b>Traps:</b>Traps are generally more eco-friendly than other fishing methods since they may be tailored to catch specific species of fish.</li>
