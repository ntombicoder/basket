            <h2> Understanding Overfishing</h2>
            <p>Overfishing is the practice of capturing fish at a rate that exceeds their ability to reproduce, resulting in the depletion of fish populations. In South Africa, overfishing is a significant concern, leading to the extinction of numerous fish species.
             Overfishing is a problem not only for fish populations but also for the entire environment. It disrupts the delicate functioning of ecosystems, causing negative effects on marine mammals, birds, and plants, among others. Furthermore, exploitation can result in economic losses for areas that depend on fishing for their sustenance.

            <h2>The effects of Overfising</h2>
            <p>The effects of exploitation on fish life and the environment are severe. Certain species of fish can become extinct due to overfishing, which can have a significant impact on the food chain. This can result in the extinction of other marine species, such as mammals and animals, that depend on these fish for survival.
                In addition to destroying habitats, overfishing can have long-lasting effects on the environment. For instance, bottom trawling, which consists of hauling a weighted net across the ocean floor, can harm coral reefs and other vital habitats.
